# 👨‍🏫 Deploy-Qualys-Cloud-Agent-from-Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on deploying Qualys Cloud Agent from Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Azure, applicable to both Windows and Linux virtual machines. By following these steps, you can strengthen your security infrastructure, extending vulnerability management capabilities to your cloud workloads. This deployment enables the assessment of vulnerability findings within both Microsoft Defender for Cloud and your Qualys subscription, ensuring a robust and integrated approach to securing your Azure environment.

# **Here's how it works**

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is like a control center for keeping your Azure infrastructure safe. It works with Qualys, a tool for checking vulnerabilities. Here's how it works: If some virtual machines don't have the right protection, Microsoft Defender for Cloud takes care of it. It puts small Qualys agents on these machines to collect info about potential issues and this process is automated. This info goes to the Qualys Cloud Platform, which then sends back details about vulnerabilities and health. It's like a teamwork system to keep everything secure and in check.
